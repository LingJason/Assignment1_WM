# WB Assignment 1
Use React to create a front-end web app (one page).

There will be a form section to prompt the user to input their first name, last name and telephone number and a history list section to display the information that the user has input. Once the user submits the information, the history list will update, and the new record will be added to the history list section. The user can input as many records as they want.

Don’t need to worry about the back-end to hold the records. The records don’t need to be kept and shared between sessions. Just the front-end part will be good enough
